Cottontail TODOs
================

  - Sort rendering by blend state
  - Make texture upload use of `ImageBitmaps` when available
  - Generally reduce use of GL enums at user level
  - Clean up `Scene` logic, maybe rename to `WebXRSampleScene`?
  - Default controller visualization
  - Make Loading of multiple GLTF meshes more practical

Nice to haves
-------------

  - Support GLTF skeletal animations
  - Support Draco compression
  - "Floaties"
  - HTML-to-texture for captions. (SVG?)
